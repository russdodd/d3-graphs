			<h2>The Process</h2>
            <pre>
I started off by drawing the x axis. This meant formating the data so that it could be used in labeling. I created a formated set of the data where the times are replaced with the js date format. At the same time I found the max and min of the times in order to create the domain of the x axis. When I created the x axis I used a custom format for the ticks so that it displayed the ticks in the shown format on the graph. I had to create a second x axis element with a different style so that I could have a second axis across the top with the ticks above the line.
I then added in the stations on the left of the graph so that the labels were at a distance apart that represented their actual distances. I then added a horizontal line for each station. 
Adding the lines included making a function that turned the data into a string starting with M and then the scaled coordinates seperated by "L" to create a line. The mouse over function thickens the line and increases the opacity while the mouseout function does the opposite. 

Extra credit: I then added a feature that draws a line on every start and stop of the highlighted train. This makes it clearer as to when the exact times are.

I then added the feature which draws a vertical line that moves with the line. I organised it so the line disappears when a train line is highlighted.
